     * resolution, if necessary) as the primary identifier for the problem type.
     *
     * When not present, the value is assumed to be "about:blank".
     *
     * If the type URI is a locator (e.g., with an "http" or "https" scheme),
     * dereferencing it SHOULD provide human-readable documentation for the
     * problem type (e.g., using HTML [HTML5]). However, consumers SHOULD NOT
     * automatically dereference the type URI unless providing information to
     * developers (e.g., when using a debugging tool).
     *
     * When "type" contains a relative URI, it is resolved relative to the
     * document's base URI (as per [URI], Section 5). Using relative URIs may
     * cause confusion and might not be handled correctly by all implementations.
     * It is RECOMMENDED to use absolute URIs in "type" when possible. If relative
     * URIs are used, include the full path (e.g., "/types/123").
     *
     * The type URI is allowed to be a non-resolvable URI. For example, the tag
     * URI scheme [TAG] can be used to uniquely identify problem types:
     *
     * tag:example@example.org,2021-09-17:OutOfLuck
     *
     * Resolvable type URIs are encouraged for future resolution capabilities,
     * as using non-resolvable URIs may introduce breaking changes when adopting
     * tools that resolve type URIs to discover information about the error.
